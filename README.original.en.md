## 📌 Introduction

**TurnSense** is a **three-class semantic turn detection model** designed for human-machine speech interaction. It focuses on a core problem in conversational systems:

> **Should the system respond immediately while the user is speaking, or should it keep waiting?**

Traditional approaches usually perform only binary "end-of-turn" detection. **TurnSense goes further** by jointly modeling semantic completeness and invalid input detection. This helps systems achieve more natural turn-taking in complex real-world scenarios and significantly reduces premature interruption, overlapping speech, and invalid triggers.

## 🎬 Demo Video

    <img src="./image/PR视频-封面.jpg" width="820" alt="TurnSense demo video">
  </a>
</p>

TurnSense classifies user input into three semantic states:

| State | Meaning | Example |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| ✅ **Complete** | The user's expression forms a complete intent, and the system can respond | `"Please check tomorrow's weather in Shanghai."` |
| ⏳ **Incomplete** | The user's expression is not finished and may continue after a pause or truncation | `"I want to ask about that order from yesterday..."` |
| 🔇 **Invalid** | The input does not form valid semantic content and should not trigger a response | `"...(continuous noise / nonverbal vocalization)"` |

</div>

These three labels allow the system to determine not only **"whether it should take the turn"**, but also **"whether the input is worth responding to"**. This improves interaction naturalness and system stability in voice assistants, real-time calls, intelligent customer service, and other speech interaction scenarios.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🧠 Semantic-Level Three-Class Detection

TurnSense jointly models `complete / incomplete / invalid` states. Compared with traditional binary turn detection, this is closer to real conversational behavior. It is also the only open-source solution that natively supports invalid semantic detection.

### 🌐 TurnSense 1.1: Enhanced English Capability

TurnSense 1.1 keeps the `complete / incomplete / invalid` three-class capability while focusing on improving semantic completeness detection in English scenarios.

Compared with the initial version, TurnSense 1.1 is better suited for bilingual voice assistants, English customer service, real-time meeting transcription, and cross-lingual human-machine interaction. It more reliably distinguishes complete English intent from unfinished English utterances.

### 📦 Lightweight Deployment

TurnSense maintains a lightweight design with about **47M** parameters and provides FP32 / INT8 ONNX versions, making it easy to integrate into CPU environments and edge deployment scenarios.

### 🎯 Strong Accuracy

On `easyturn_real_test_ZH` with 300 samples, TurnSense achieves **F1 96.35%** for `complete` and **F1 96.32%** for `incomplete`. On `semantic_test_ZH` with 2000 samples, it achieves **F1 92.30%** for `complete` and **F1 91.62%** for `incomplete`, reaching best or second-best performance among comparable models.

### 🚫 Invalid Input Filtering

On the NonverbalVocalization dataset, invalid utterance detection reaches **100% precision**, **90.37% recall**, and **94.34% F1**, effectively suppressing false activations caused by nonverbal vocalizations and noise.

### ⚖️ More Robust Turn-Taking Decisions

TurnSense balances precision and recall in semantically ambiguous, paused, or colloquial speech scenarios, reducing premature responses and missed responses.

### 📊 Reproducible Evaluation Pipeline

The project includes a complete evaluation workflow and scripts, supporting unified metric comparison and performance regression analysis to ensure reproducibility.

### 🤗 Open-Source Friendly and Ready to Use

TurnSense provides a standardized repository structure and FP32 / INT8 ONNX models. Installation and inference can be completed within minutes.

## 🧪 Evaluation Guide

### 1. Evaluation Pipeline

1. Read test datasets in `.jsonl` format.
2. Warm up each model first. The default value is `warmup_iters=20`.
3. Run inference sample by sample and collect classification and performance metrics.
4. Automatically export summary reports and detailed result files.

Output files include:

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `report.md` | Summary evaluation report |
| `results.json` | Structured evaluation results |
| `config.json` | Evaluation configuration |
| `per_sample__*.jsonl` | Per-sample prediction results |

### 2. Data Format Requirements（JSONL）

Each line should be a JSON object containing at least the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `audio_path` | Path to the audio file |
| `text` | Text content |
| `label` | Label: `complete` / `incomplete` / `invalid` |

Example:

```jsonl
{"audio_path":"/001.wav","text":"Please check tomorrow's weather in Shanghai.","label":"complete"}
{"audio_path":"/002.wav","text":"I want to ask about that order from yesterday...","label":"incomplete"}
{"audio_path":"/003.wav","text":"uh... hmm... continuous noise","label":"invalid"}
```

### 3. Run Evaluation

```bash
python TurnSense/Turn_benchmark/benchmark.py
```
